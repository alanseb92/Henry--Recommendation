# Location based Recommendation
Recommender system has the ability to predict whether a particular user would prefer an item or not based on the user's profile.
Recommendation systems are beneficial to both users and providers.
In this project we are building a recommendation system/model that will recommend us restaurants in a particular destination taking in your longitude and latitude geographic location.

Details of the project.
We will be taking in our dataset and train our model according to reviews it has and its location using K mean clustering.
We will also see how to portray geographical data onto google colab notebook using plotly libraries (and geo pandas) and more.
Lastly we will build function that will take geographical data as input and recommend restaurants to the users.

Machine Learning Model
We will start off with building a machine learning model using K-Means clustering model and train that model using the dataset. For this project, you will have to understand all the libraries are used before implementing the code.

Types of Recommendation system
There are mainly two types of recommendation system and a hybrid of these two types.

Content based filtering: It makes recommendation based on users preferences, for product features.
Collaborative filtering: It mimic user to user recommendation.
